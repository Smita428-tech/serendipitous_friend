    <h1>Friendship's Serendipitous Journey</h1>
    <p>
        In the halls of college, our paths did cross,<br>
        A connection formed, a friendship embossed.<br>
        She spoke with joy on that first induction day,<br>
        Of naphthalene balls, in her own unique way.<br><br>
        
        I remember it well, her words in the air,<br>
        A spark of curiosity, a glimpse of a flare.<br>
        I wanted to speak, to know her much more,<br>
        Little did I know what the future held in store.<br><br>
        
        She asked for my help, a drawing request,<br>
        But foolishly, I denied, to my own regret.<br>
        Perhaps she was hurt, her trust I did break,<br>
        Yet fate had a plan, our bond it would make.<br><br>
        
        Tickets were needed, and she turned to me,<br>
        Quiet and reserved, I pondered, should I agree?<br>
        Against my nature, I said yes with a smile,<br>
        Unbeknownst to me, it would be worthwhile.<br><br>
        
        The day before the journey, a question arose,<br>
        "I have a boyfriend, he'll join us, do you oppose?"<br>
        A moment of truth, a test of my heart,<br>
        Would I let envy tear our friendship apart?<br><br>
        
        But I chose friendship, over selfish desire,<br>
        Supporting her journey, my soul felt on fire.<br>
        For true friends stand by, in both joy and strife,<br>
        Embracing each other's unique paths in life.<br><br>
        
        She often spoke for me when conditions were odd,<br>
        Calming the anger, bringing peace, a soothing nod.<br>
        She asked me to change rooms, to be closer still,<br>
        A chance to deepen our bond, a choice to fulfill.<br><br>
        
        Regret weighed heavy, as the room shift came near,<br>
        I wanted to share a space, to hold her dear.<br>
        But self-sabotage held me back, I hesitated,<br>
        Creating distance, a void that lingered unabated.<br><br>
        
        Days drifted by, she met newer faces with glee,<br>
        While I held onto memories, longing to be free.<br>
        Yet in my heart, her place remained secure,<br>
        This poem, a testament, a love that endures.<br><br>
        
        Eagerly awaiting semester exams, I'd wait,<br>
        For she'd invite me, studying together, fate.<br>
        Her fluent words, my stammers, complemented so

,<br>
        A perfect harmony, as we'd strive and grow.<br><br>
        
        Her love for activities, participation with zest,<br>
        While I focused on studies, feeling I'd done less.<br>
        But she taught me to love, to embrace the world wide,<br>
        To break free from silence, let my soul inside.<br><br>
        
        Oh, how she weaved a spell, so ineffably,<br>
        Unshackling my heart, setting my spirit free.<br>
        I learned to love myself, and this world too,<br>
        And most of all, my serendipitous buddy, I love you.<br><br>
        
        In the tapestry of our college days, so dear,<br>
        Destiny wove our stories, forever intertwined, I fear.<br>
        From naphthalene balls to room requests and more,<br>
        Our friendship's foundation grew stronger than before.<br><br>
        
        So let this poem be a testament, a fusion of our tales,<br>
        Of laughter and tears, of friendship that never fails.<br>
        For in those college memories, forever we'll be,<br>
        Two souls connected, bound eternally.<br>
    </p>
